# SQL EMPLOYEE TRACKER
  
## Description:
This application is a built in command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySql. I learned alot on utilizing primary keys from different tables to manipulate data in order to display what I want. The biggest challenge I had for this project was to stay consistent in my column naming and calling my queries based on my schema.sql. Something I tried doing differently is utilizing a utils folder that holds the bulk of my code that would be routed to my index.js so that I can compartmentalize my work. Moving forward I think I will compartmentalize my work even further so it is easier to read code and minimize the quantity of lines of code per file. 

## User Story
```md
AS A business owner  
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
